# Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning and Image Processing

This project aims to detect emotions in IT professionals using advanced Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques. The system focuses on real-time emotion detection from images captured through a browser interface.

The process begins with image processing, where the input image is converted into a digital format and enhanced to extract meaningful features. These features are then fed into a Machine Learning model, such as a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, to classify the emotion displayed by the individual.

The emotions detected include Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, and Sad. The identified emotion is highlighted in a bounding box on the image, providing clear visual feedback.

This system can be used for applications requiring emotion recognition in real-time scenarios, offering insights into user states through live emotion detection.
